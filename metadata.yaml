description: The novel begins The world considered Eugene Lane a very fortunate young
  man; and if youth, health, social reputation, a seat in Parliament, a large income,
  and finally the promised hand of an acknowledged beauty can make a man happy, the
  world was right." In this book, a young Anglican priest, torn between love and faith,
  must reconcile the urgings of body and soul.
